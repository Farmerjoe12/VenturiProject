# So you want to contribute?

You've followed the steps in HOWTO, made your own project, and now you're interested in sharing it with the repository! That's great, but we want to first make sure that you're following tradition and everything will sit together nicely. Let's break it down a bit.

## First things first

When you want to make any addition to the repository, don't try and commit to master. I repeat, *don't try and commit to master*. You should follow good git behavior by creating your own branch, making informative commits there, and politely requesting to merge with master.

## You made some stuff

Your scripts are complete and your branch is ready to merge with master. But wait! You didn't add any comments to your code, your code looks like mom's spaghetti, and it *just works*™. Follow the checklist, please.

1. Make sure your code is commented and well documented
2. Repeat step 1
3. Do your best to make sure code is easily readable
4. Double-Check everything

## You want to add a new controller or sensor

So you've got something that we don't have, and you're feeling generous. We'd love to have your functionality to run a windmill, create hydroelectric power, or build a house! Although that stuff isn't likely to be in this repository, your scripts probably belong here and they're welcome. Feel free to follow "First things first" and create a new branch, and request a merge.

## You want to add a new project

So you actually went and made a project. You've compiled different scripts into one folder and made your own script that links it all together. Great! If your format matches the repositories' feel free to create a branch and request a merge.
